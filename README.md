# tec-Floppy
### project
Get the tec1 using MINT and/or ASM code to control an old 5.1/4 inch floppy drive or a  3 1/2 inch, the old fashoned way, with IO circuit. Then read and write to the disk.

"The first floppy disks, invented and made by IBM, had a disk diameter of 8 inches (203.2 mm).[1] Subsequently, the 5¼-inch and then the 3½-inch became a ubiquitous form of data storage and transfer into the first years of the 21st century.[2] 3½-inch floppy disks can still be used with an external USB floppy disk drive....The most common capacity of the 5¼-inch format in DOS-based PCs was 360 KB...In 1984, IBM introduced with its PC-AT model the 1.2 MB dual-sided 5¼-inch floppy disk, but it never became very popular." Now that right where the Tec-1 was born, so thats period correct.... " IBM started using the 720 KB double density 3½-inch microfloppy disk on its Convertible laptop computer in 1986 and the 1.44 MB high-density version with the IBM Personal System/2 (PS/2) line in 1987." so lets use that here.
