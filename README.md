# tec-Floppy
### project
Get the tec1 using MINT and/or ASM code to control an old 5.1/4 inch floppy drive or a  3 1/2 inch, the old fashoned way, with IO circuit. Then read and write to the disk.

"The most common capacity of the 5¼-inch format in DOS-based PCs was 360 KB...In 1984, IBM introduced ...1.2 MB 5¼-inch", right where the Tec-1 was born, so thats period correct.... "...the 720 KB double density 3½-inch microfloppy... 1986 and 1.44 MB high-density ... in 1987." so lets use that for the Tec-1.
I like the RC2014 floppy controller so will adapt this.
